-----How to Build and Run Docker Image-----

Build the Docker Image:
    docker build -t your_image_name .

Run the Docker Container:
    docker run -v /path/on/host/Desktop:/app your_image_name
Replace "/path/on/host/Desktop" with the absolute path to your "Desktop" folder on the host machine.

If your code doesn't depend on an environment file, you can comment out the line:
# COPY .env /app/

Script Changes:
Check the script for modifications marked with comments like #change. These are adjustments made for containerized environment paths.
This will mount your host machine's "Desktop" folder to the "/app" directory inside the container. Adjust the path accordingly based on your host system.
